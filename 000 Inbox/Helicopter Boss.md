# Helicopter Boss
###### Jefe Helicóptero
---

Son aquellos jefes que tienen la necesidad de controlar todo lo que hacen sus empleados, que dictan lo que tienen que hacer, cómo hacerlo y hasta cuándo hacerlo.

Es aquel que siempre está monitoreando lo que se hace, haciendo sugerencias aun cuando estas no han sido solicitadas.

El término se acuña del término *Padres Helicópteros* (Helicopter Parents).

Estos jefes pueden tener muy buenas intenciones, pero sienten la imperiosa necesidad de controlar cada aspecto del trabajo de sus empleados, tomar todas las decisiones por ellos, con el fin de prevenir así *los errores*.

Planean y monitorean cada movimiento no permitiendo que los empleados tomen decisiones, asuman riesgos y solucionen sus problemas por ellos mismos.

Esto lo que logra es que los empleados se cohiban de aprender, desarrollarse y crecer.

Usted probablemente es un jefe helicóptero si:

-   You do not trust others to perform work on their own.
-   You refuse to delegate anything because no one can do it as well or as fast as you can.
-   You are constantly checking in and hovering over your direct reports, even when they have not asked for your help.
-   You are burned out and lack work/life balance.
-   Your team suffers from low morale because you second-guess everything it does.
-   Your team has a high turnover rate.
-   Your team produces low-quality work and/or is not productive.
-   Your team is not profitable.
-   Your team lacks bench strength in terms of successorship.

If you are a helicopter boss and do not allow your employees to make at least some of their own decisions, you set yourself up to have a dissatisfied and unproductive workforce. Many of your talented employees will simply leave rather than put up with a manager who constantly hovers and micromanages. Research indicates that one the top reasons people leave companies is because of poor relationships with their managers. Replacing these employees can cost up to 2.5 times of their salaries, which takes its toll on the company’s bottom line.

Good managers do not hover over their employees. They involve their people in the decision-making process by teaching them how to make good decisions for the organization. Good managers do not problem solve for their employees, but instead coach them to solve problems on their own. Good managers trust their employees, and in turn that trust is reciprocated. By not micromanaging every aspect of their people’s jobs, good managers help employees develop and grow, which benefits the entire organization.

If you have ever worked with this type of manager and would like to share your experiences, we would love to hear from you.
